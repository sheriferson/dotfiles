#: Window appearance {{{

# lines 25

#: The number of lines shown in the panel. Ignored for background,
#: centered, and vertical panels. If it has the suffix px then it sets
#: the height of the panel in pixels instead of lines.

# columns 80

#: The number of columns shown in the panel. Ignored for background,
#: centered, and horizontal panels. If it has the suffix px then it
#: sets the width of the panel in pixels instead of columns.

edge top

#: Which edge of the screen to place the panel on. Note that some
#: window managers (such as i3) do not support placing docked windows
#: on the left and right edges. The value background means make the
#: panel the "desktop wallpaper". Note that when using sway if you set
#: a background in your sway config it will cover the background drawn
#: using this kitten. Additionally, there are three more values:
#: center, center-sized and none. The value center anchors the panel
#: to all sides and covers the entire display (on macOS the part of
#: the display not covered by titlebar and dock). The panel can be
#: shrunk and placed using the margin parameters. The value none
#: anchors the panel to the top left corner and should be placed using
#: the margin parameters. Its size is set by lines and columns. The
#: value center-sized is just like none except that the panel is
#: centered instead of in the top left corner and the margins have no
#: effect.

# background_opacity 0.85

#: The background opacity of the window. This works the same as the
#: kitty option of the same name, it is present here as it has a
#: different default value for the quick access terminal.

# hide_on_focus_loss no

#: Hide the window when it loses keyboard focus automatically. Using
#: this option will force focus_policy to on-demand.

grab_keyboard yes

#: Grab the keyboard. This means global shortcuts defined in the OS
#: will be passed to kitty instead. Useful if you want to create an OS
#: modal window. How well this works depends on the OS/window
#: manager/desktop environment. On Wayland it works only if the
#: compositor implements the inhibit-keyboard-shortcuts protocol
#: <https://wayland.app/protocols/keyboard-shortcuts-inhibit-
#: unstable-v1>. On macOS Apple doesn't allow applications to grab the
#: keyboard without special permissions, so it doesn't work.

# margin_left 0

#: Set the left margin for the panel, in pixels. Has no effect for
#: right edge panels. Only works on macOS and Wayland compositors that
#: supports the wlr layer shell protocol.

# margin_right 0

#: Set the right margin for the panel, in pixels. Has no effect for
#: left edge panels. Only works on macOS and Wayland compositors that
#: supports the wlr layer shell protocol.

# margin_top 0

#: Set the top margin for the panel, in pixels. Has no effect for
#: bottom edge panels. Only works on macOS and Wayland compositors
#: that supports the wlr layer shell protocol.

# margin_bottom 0

#: Set the bottom margin for the panel, in pixels. Has no effect for
#: top edge panels. Only works on macOS and Wayland compositors that
#: supports the wlr layer shell protocol.

# kitty_conf

#: Path to config file to use for kitty when drawing the window. Can
#: be specified multiple times. By default, the normal kitty.conf is
#: used. Relative paths are resolved with respect to the kitty config
#: directory.

# kitty_override

#: Override individual kitty configuration options, can be specified
#: multiple times. Syntax: name=value. For example: font_size=20.

# app_id kitty-quick-access

#: On Wayland set the namespace of the layer shell surface. On X11 set
#: the WM_CLASS assigned to the quick access window. (Linux only)

# output_name

#: The panel can only be displayed on a single monitor (output) at a
#: time. This allows you to specify which output is used, by name. If
#: not specified the compositor will choose an output automatically,
#: typically the last output the user interacted with or the primary
#: monitor. Run kitten panel --output-name list to get a list of
#: available outputs. Use listjson for a json encoded output.

# start_as_hidden no

#: Whether to start the quick access terminal hidden. Useful if you
#: are starting it as part of system startup.

# focus_policy exclusive

#: On a Wayland compositor that supports the wlr layer shell protocol,
#: specify the focus policy for keyboard interactivity with the panel.
#: Please refer to the wlr layer shell protocol documentation for more
#: details. Note that different Wayland compositors behave very
#: differently with exclusive, your mileage may vary. On macOS,
#: exclusive and on-demand are currently the same.
