# todos.widget

An [Ãœbersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/) widget that shows me my tasks for today.

The script uses my tasks text file that I maintain using [t](https://github.com/sheriferson/t), my modified fork of [Steve Losh](http://stevelosh.com)'s [original t](https://github.com/sjl/t).

I use the `@today` suffix to mark a task as one for today, and because it's all text, this works with the original or modified fork.

Long live plain text.
