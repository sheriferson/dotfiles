# AppleScripts

**Note**: All iTunes-related scripts work on Mojave but will likely need to be changed to work with Catalina since iTunes is not even a thing there.

Two destinations:

- `~/Library/Scripts` for scripts that are generally available. I use [FastScripts][] to run them.
  - Scripts to rate what's playing in iTunes with a quick keyboard shortcut (usually mapped to Ctrl-1 to Ctrl-5)
    - `iTunes set to 1 stars.scpt`
    - `iTunes set to 2 stars.scpt`
    - `iTunes set to 3 stars.scpt`
    - `iTunes set to 4 stars.scpt`
    - `iTunes set to 5 stars.scpt`
  - Show a list of open tabs in Safari and paste a URL from the list.
    - `Paste URL from Safari Tab.scpt`

- `~/Library/iTunes/Scripts/`
  - `Play Random album.scptd`
